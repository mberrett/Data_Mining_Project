Final Project for Data Mining CISC 6930 
by Matias Berretta, Vaibhav Dixit, Rohini Mandge

Using income data extracted from the US Census Bureau (63,000 instances, 14 features), we generated a prediction model for citizen salary level (<=50k or >50k), programmed in R and Python, by implementing a bagged ensemble model of five algorithms, which yielded a ~86% accuracy, ~64% precision, ~73% recall and ~68% F-1 Score.
