Project Outline

Test Ensemble Classifier consisiting of five other classifiers: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes. 

For each data set, test ensemble classifier with and without bagging from sklearn.ensemble to address unbalanced nature of the data. 

1. Section 1: Preliminary Test

    a) Drop All Missing Values
    i. test with and without bagging 

2. Section 2: Imputation
    
    a) Imputation

    i. Mode (most-frequent) Imputation

    ii. RandomForest Imputation

    iii. KNN Imputation

3. Section 3: Optimization

    a) Find the best parameters for each algorithm in the ensemble classifier
